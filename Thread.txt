thread of execution defined as smallest unit that can be  scheduled in an OS.
threads contained with in a process. more than one thread can exist in a process.
These threads share memory and state of the process . threads share value of the variable.

two kinds :
- kernel threads [part of OS]
- user threads

every process has atleast one thread , the process itself .
a process can start multiple threads . OS executes these threads like parallel processes. if a single processor  , parallelism 
achieved via thread scheduling .

advantages:
- on multiple CPU computers multiple thread programs run faster , threads run concurrently .
- program can remain responsive to the input 
- share memory of global variables.


modules supporting usage of threads in python :
- thread
- threading

thread is depriceated : hence lets start with threading .
